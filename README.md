Basic E-Commerce Data Rendering using React Toolkit
This file aims to articulate the use of Redux Toolkit to manage state across (any) entire application, allowing any component to access the state without needing to follow the component hierarchy. 
I built a simple E-Commerce application using React and Redux where I displayed a list of products, each with an "Add to Cart" button. 
I also implemented functionality to show the items added to the cart and allowed users to remove items from it. 
Using Redux Toolkit, I ensured that all this information was globally accessible throughout the application.
