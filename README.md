# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
This small app aims to articulate the use of Redux Toolkit to manage state throughout my entire application, making it accessible from any component without following the component hierarchy. 
I built a simple E-Commerce application using React and Redux, where I displayed a list of products with an "Add to Cart" button for each item
I also showed the items added to the cart, and allowed users to remove items from the cart. 
With Redux Toolkit, all this information is globally available throughout the application.

*Node modules not included that are necessary for running the Redux toolkits and the hooks, you'll need to install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux as a third-party module.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
